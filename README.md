## Sea ice maps from ship radar
Many vessels are equipped with radar to aid navigation. Sea ice can be visually differentiated from water in these images. This project uses screengrabs from *USCGC Healy's* radar during a 2018 research cruise to make maps of sea ice conditions. These maps provide useful regional context for oceanographic measurements with higher spatial resoltion that would be available from e.g., satellite-based imagery. 

This figure provides an overview of the  procedure for making maps by compositing screen shots of Healyâ€™s radar:

## Photos

Directories containing the photos of the radar screen from which the maps can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WPJR5JkLdMTmpazkbPyDFuCxHcOFSyVb?usp=drive_link) (first sesssion) and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HhrKUJ9u2-QCaL8KBZ-bWemg_db63spe?usp=drive_link) (second session). 

Here is an example of an unprocessed screenshot from the ship's radar

## Geolocated Maps
Here is an example map created from many radar screenshots along an underway CTD sampling transect.
